# Change log for kotlinx.coroutines 

## Version 0.17

* `CompletableDeferred` is introduced as a set-once event-like communication primitive (see #70).
  * [Coroutines guide](coroutines-guide.md) uses it in a section on actors.
  * `CompletableDeferred` is an interface with private impl (courtesy of @fvasco, see #86).
  * It extends `Deferred` interface with `complete` and `completeExceptionally` functions.
* `Job.join` and `Deferred.await` wait until a cancelled coroutine stops execution (see #64). 
  * `Job` and `Deferred` have a new _cancelling_ state which they enter on invocation of `cancel`.
  * `Job.invokeOnCompletion` has an additional overload with `onCancelling: Boolean` parameter to 
    install handlers that are fired as soon as coroutine enters _cancelling_ state as opposed
    to waiting until it _completes_.
  * Internal `select` implementation is refactored to decouple it from `JobSupport` internal class 
    and to optimize its state-machine.  
  * Internal `AbstractCoroutine` class is refactored so that it is extended only by true coroutines, 
    all of which support the new _cancelling_ state.  
* `CoroutineScope.context` is renamed to `coroutineContext` to avoid conflicts with other usages of `context`
  in applications (like Android context, see #75).       
* `BroadcastChannel.open` is renamed to `openSubscription` (see #54).
* Fixed `StackOverflowError` in a convoy of `Mutex.unlock` invokers with `Unconfined` dispatcher (see #80).
* Fixed `SecurityException` when trying to use coroutines library with installed `SecurityManager`.
* Fixed a bug in `withTimeoutOrNull` in case with nested timeouts when coroutine was cancelled before it was
  ever suspended.
* Fixed a minor problem with `awaitFirst` on reactive streams that would have resulted in spurious stack-traces printed
  on the console when used with publishers/observables that continue to invoke `onNext` despite being cancelled/disposed 
  (which they are technically allowed to do by specification). 
* All factory functions for various interfaces are implemented as top-level functions
  (affects `Job`, `Channel`, `BroadcastChannel`, `Mutex`, `EventLoop`, and `CoroutineExceptionHandler`). 
  Previous approach of using `operator invoke` on their companion objects is deprecated. 
* Nicer-to-use debug `toString` implementations for coroutine dispatcher tasks and continuations.  
* A default dispatcher for `delay` is rewritten and now shares code with `EventLoopImpl` that is used by 
  `runBlocking`. It internally supports non-default `TimeSource` so that delay-using tests can be written 
  with "virtual time" by replacing their time source for the duration of tests (this feature is not available
  outside of the library).

## Version 0.16

* Coroutines that are scheduled for execution are cancellable by default now
  * `suspendAtomicCancellableCoroutine` function is introduced for funs like
    `send`/`receive`/`receiveOrNull` that require atomic cancellation
    (they cannot be cancelled after decision was made)
  * Coroutines started with default mode using
    `async`/`launch`/`actor` builders can be cancelled before their execution starts
  * `CoroutineStart.ATOMIC` is introduced as a start mode to specify that
    coroutine cannot be cancelled before its execution starts
  * `run` function is also cancellable in the same way and accepts an optional
    `CoroutineStart` parameter to change this default.
* `BroadcastChannel` factory function is introduced
* `CoroutineExceptionHandler` factory function is introduced by @konrad-kaminski
* [`integration`](integration) directory is introduced for all 3rd party integration projects
  * It has [contribution guidelines](integration/README.md#contributing) and contributions from community are welcome
  * Support for Guava `ListenableFuture` in the new [`kotlinx-coroutines-guava`](integration/kotlinx-coroutines-guava) module
  * Rx1 Scheduler support by @konrad-kaminski
* Fixed a number of `Channel` and `BroadcastChannel` implementation bugs related to concurrent 
  send/close/close of channels that lead to hanging send, offer or close operations (see #66). 
  Thanks to @chrisly42 and @cy6erGn0m for finding them.
* Fixed `withTimeoutOrNull` which was returning `null` on timeout of inner or outer `withTimeout` blocks (see #67).
  Thanks to @gregschlom for finding the problem.
* Fixed a bug where `Job` fails to dispose a handler when it is the only handler by @uchuhimo

## Version 0.15

* Switched to Kotlin version 1.1.2 (can still be used with 1.1.0).
* `CoroutineStart` enum is introduced for `launch`/`async`/`actor` builders:
  * The usage of `luanch(context, start = false)` is deprecated and is replaced with 
    `launch(context, CoroutineStart.LAZY)`
  * `CoroutineStart.UNDISPATCHED` is introduced to start coroutine execution immediately in the invoker thread,
     so that `async(context, CoroutineStart.UNDISPATCHED)` is similar to the behavior of C# `async`.
  * [Guide to UI programming with coroutines](ui/coroutines-guide-ui.md) mentions the use of it to optimize
    the start of coroutines from UI threads.
* Introduced `BroadcastChannel` interface in `kotlinx-coroutines-core` module:
  * It extends `SendChannel` interface and provides `open` function to create subscriptions.
  * Subscriptions are represented with `SubscriptionReceiveChannel` interface. 
  * The corresponding `SubscriptionReceiveChannel` interfaces are removed from [reactive](reactive) implementation
     modules. They use an interface defined in `kotlinx-coroutines-core` module.
  * `ConflatedBroadcastChannel` implementation is provided for state-observation-like use-cases, where a coroutine or a
     regular code (in UI, for example) updates the state that subscriber coroutines shall react to.
  * `ArrayBroadcastChannel` implementation is provided for event-bus-like use-cases, where a sequence of events shall
     be received by multiple subscribers without any omissions.
  * [Guide to reactive streams with coroutines](reactive/coroutines-guide-reactive.md) includes 
    "Rx Subject vs BroadcastChannel" section.
* Pull requests from Konrad Kamiński are merged into reactive stream implementations:
  * Support for Project Reactor `Mono` and `Flux`. 
    See [`kotlinx-coroutines-reactor`](reactive/kotlinx-coroutines-reactor) module.
  * Implemented Rx1 `Completable.awaitCompleted`.
  * Added support for Rx2 `Maybe`.
* Better timeout support:  
  * Introduced `withTimeoutOrNull` function.
  * Implemented `onTimeout` clause for `select` expressions.
  * Fixed spurious concurrency inside `withTimeout` blocks on their cancellation. 
  * Changed behavior of `withTimeout` when `CancellationException` is suppressed inside the block. 
    Invocation of `withTimeout` now always returns the result of execution of its inner block.
* The `channel` property in `ActorScope` is promoted to a wider `Channel` type, so that an actor
  can have an easy access to its own inbox send channel.
* Renamed `Mutex.withMutex` to `Mutex.withLock`, old name is deprecated.  

## Version 0.14
 
* Switched to Kotlin version 1.1.1 (can still be used with 1.1.0).
* Introduced `consumeEach` helper function for channels and reactive streams, Rx 1.x, and Rx 2.x.
  * It ensures that streams are unsubscribed from on any exception.
  * Iteration with `for` loop on reactive streams is **deprecated**.
  * [Guide to reactive streams with coroutines](reactive/coroutines-guide-reactive.md) is updated virtually
    all over the place to reflect these important changes.
* Implemented `awaitFirstOrDefault` extension for reactive streams, Rx 1.x, and Rx 2.x.
* Added `Mutex.withMutex` helper function.
* `kotlinx-coroutines-android` module has `provided` dependency on of Android APIs to 
  eliminate warnings when using it in android project.

## Version 0.13

* New `kotlinx-coroutinex-android` module with Android `UI` context implementation. 
* Introduced `whileSelect` convenience function.
* Implemented `ConflatedChannel`.  
* Renamed various `toXXX` conversion functions to `asXXX` (old names are deprecated).
* `run` is optimized with fast-path case and no longer has `CoroutineScope` in its block.
* Fixed dispatching logic of `withTimeout` (removed extra dispatch).
* `EventLoop` that is used by `runBlocking` now implements Delay, giving more predictable test behavior.
* Various refactorings related to resource management and timeouts:
  * `Job.Registration` is renamed to `DisposableHandle`.
  * `EmptyRegistration` is renamed to `NonDisposableHandle`.
  * `Job.unregisterOnCompletion` is renamed to `Job.disposeOnCompletion`.
  * `Delay.invokeOnTimeout` is introduced.
  * `withTimeout` now uses `Delay.invokeOnTimeout` when available.
* A number of improvement for reactive streams and Rx:
  * Introduced `rxFlowable` builder for Rx 2.x.
  * `Scheduler.asCoroutineDispatcher` extension for Rx 2.x.
  * Fixed bug with sometimes missing `onComplete` in `publish`, `rxObservable`, and `rxFlowable` builders.
  * Channels that are open for reactive streams are now `Closeable`.
  * Fixed `CompletableSource.await` and added test for it.
  * Removed `rx.Completable.await` due to name conflict.
* New documentation:
  * [Guide to UI programming with coroutines](ui/coroutines-guide-ui.md)
  * [Guide to reactive streams with coroutines](reactive/coroutines-guide-reactive.md)
* Code is published to JCenter repository.

## Version 0.12

* Switched to Kotlin version 1.1.0 release.
* Reworked and updated utilities for 
  [Reactive Streams](kotlinx-coroutines-reactive), 
  [Rx 1.x](kotlinx-coroutines-rx1), and 
  [Rx 2.x](kotlinx-coroutines-rx2) with library-specific 
  coroutine builders, suspending functions, converters and iteration support.
* `LinkedListChannel` with unlimited buffer (`offer` always succeeds).
* `onLock` select clause and an optional `owner` parameter in all `Mutex` functions.
* `selectUnbiased` function.
* `actor` coroutine builder.
* Couple more examples for "Shared mutable state and concurrency" section and 
  "Channels are fair" section with ping-pong table example 
  in [coroutines guide](coroutines-guide.md).

## Version 0.11-rc

* `select` expression with onJoin/onAwait/onSend/onReceive clauses.
* `Mutex` is moved to `kotlinx.coroutines.experimental.sync` package.

* `CancellableContinuation.resumeUndispatched` is introduced to make this efficient implementation possible.
* Remove unnecessary creation of `CancellationException` to improve performance, plus other performance improvements.
* Suppress deprecated and internal APIs from docs.
* Better docs at top level with categorized summary of classes and functions.

## Version 0.8-beta

* `defer` coroutine builder is renamed to `async`.
* `lazyDefer` is deprecated, `async` has an optional `start` parameter instead.

* `Job.getInactiveCancellationException` is renamed to `getCompletionException`.
* `Job.join` is now a member function.
* Internal `JobSupport` state machine is enhanced to support _new_ (not-started-yet) state.
  So, lazy coroutines do not need a separate state variable to track their started/not-started (new/active) status.
* Exception transparency in `Job.cancel` (original cause is rethrown).
* Clarified possible states for `Job`/`CancellableContinuation`/`Deferred` in docs.

* `lazyDefer(context) {...}` coroutine builder and `LazyDeferred` interface are introduced.
* The default behaviour of all coroutine dispatchers is changed to always schedule execution of new coroutine 
  for later in this thread or thread pool. Correspondingly, `CoroutineDispatcher.isDispatchNeeded` function
  has a default implementation that returns `true`.
* `NonCancellable` context is introduced.  
* Performance optimizations for cancellable continuations (fewer objects created).

* Introduced `CancellableContinuation.isCancelled`
* Introduced `EventLoop` dispatcher and made it a default for `runBlocking { ... }`
* Introduced `CoroutineScope` interface with `isActive` and `context` properties; 
  standard coroutine builders include it as receiver for convenience.
* Introduced `Executor.toCoroutineDispatcher()` extension.  
* Delay scheduler thread is not daemon anymore, but times out automatically.
* Debugging facilities in `newCoroutineContext` can be explicitly disabled with `-Dkotlinx.coroutines.debug=off`.
