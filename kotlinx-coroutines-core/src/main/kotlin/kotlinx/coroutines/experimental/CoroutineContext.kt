 * currently currently running coroutine.
 * When one coroutine is suspended and resumes another coroutine that is dispatched in the same thread,

 * the whole stack of coroutine descriptions that are being executed on this thread.

 * Enable debugging facilities with "`kotlinx.coroutines.debug`" system property, use the following values:
 * * "`auto`" (default mode) -- enabled when assertions are enabled with "`-ea`" JVM option.
 * * "`on`" or empty string -- enabled.
 * * "`off`" -- disabled.
 *
 * Coroutine name can be explicitly assigned using [CoroutineName] context element.
 * The string "coroutine" is used as a default name.
