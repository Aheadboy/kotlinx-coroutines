/**
 * A [Deferred] that can be completed via public functions
 * [complete], [completeExceptionally], and [cancel].
 *
 * Completion functions return `false` when this deferred value is already complete.
 *
 * A completable deferred value has the following states:
 *
 * | **State**                 | [isActive] | [isCompleted] | [isCompletedExceptionally] | [isCancelled] |
 * | ------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
 * | _Active_ (initial state)  | `true`     | `false`       | `false`                    | `false`       |
 * | _Cancelled_ (final state) | `false`    | `true`        | `true`                     | `true`        |
 * | _Resolved_  (final state) | `false`    | `true`        | `false`                    | `false`       |
 * | _Failed_    (final state) | `false`    | `true`        | `true`                     | `false`       |
 *
 * A an instance of completable deferred can be created by `CompletableDeferred()` function in _active_ state.
 *
 *  ```
 *  +--------+   complete   +-----------+
 *  | Active | ---------+-> | Resolved  |
 *  +--------+          |   |(completed)|
 *       |              |   +-----------+
 *       | cancel       |
 *       V              |   +-----------+
 *  +-----------+       +-> |  Failed   |
 *  | Cancelled |           |(completed)|
 *  |(completed)|           +-----------+
 *  +-----------+
