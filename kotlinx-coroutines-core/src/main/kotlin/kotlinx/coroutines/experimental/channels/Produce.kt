 * object can be used to [receive][ReceiveChannel.receive] elements produced by this coroutine.
 *
 * The scope of the coroutine contains [ProducerScope] interface, which implements
 * both [CoroutineScope] and [SendChannel], so that coroutine can invoke
 * [send][SendChannel.send] directly. The channel is [closed][SendChannel.close]
 * when the coroutine completes.
 * The running coroutine is cancelled when the its job is [cancelled][Job.cancel].
 *
 * The [context] for the new coroutine must be explicitly specified.
 * See [CoroutineDispatcher] for the standard [context] implementations that are provided by `kotlinx.coroutines`.
 * The [context][CoroutineScope.context] of the parent coroutine from its [scope][CoroutineScope] may be used,
 * in which case the [Job] of the resulting coroutine is a child of the job of the parent coroutine.
 *
 * Uncaught exceptions in this coroutine close the channel with this exception as a cause and
 * the resulting channel becomes _failed_, so that any attempt to receive from such a channel throws exception.
 *
 * See [newCoroutineContext] for a description of debugging facilities that are available for newly created coroutine.
