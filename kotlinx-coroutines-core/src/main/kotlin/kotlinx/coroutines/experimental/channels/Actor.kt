/**
 * Launches new coroutine that is receiving messages from its mailbox channel
 * and returns a reference to the coroutine as an [ActorJob]. The resulting
 * object can be used to [send][SendChannel.send] messages to this coroutine.
 *
 * The scope of the coroutine contains [ActorScope] interface, which implements
 * both [CoroutineScope] and [ReceiveChannel], so that coroutine can invoke
 * [receive][ReceiveChannel.receive] directly. The channel is [closed][SendChannel.close]
 * when the coroutine completes.
 * The running coroutine is cancelled when the its job is [cancelled][Job.cancel].
 *
 * The [context] for the new coroutine must be explicitly specified.
 * See [CoroutineDispatcher] for the standard [context] implementations that are provided by `kotlinx.coroutines`.
 * The [context][CoroutineScope.context] of the parent coroutine from its [scope][CoroutineScope] may be used,
 * in which case the [Job] of the resulting coroutine is a child of the job of the parent coroutine.
 *
 * By default, the coroutine is immediately scheduled for execution.
 * Other options can be specified via `start` parameter. See [CoroutineStart] for details.
 * An optional [start] parameter can be set to [CoroutineStart.LAZY] to start coroutine _lazily_. In this case,
 * the coroutine [Job] is created in _new_ state. It can be explicitly started with [start][Job.start] function
 * and will be started implicitly on the first invocation of [join][Job.join] or on a first message
 * [sent][SendChannel.send] to this coroutine's mailbox channel.
 *
 * Uncaught exceptions in this coroutine close the channel with this exception as a cause and
 * the resulting channel becomes _failed_, so that any attempt to send to such a channel throws exception.
 *
 * See [newCoroutineContext] for a description of debugging facilities that are available for newly created coroutine.
 *
 * @param context context of the coroutine
 * @param capacity capacity of the channel's buffer (no buffer by default)
 * @param start coroutine start option
 * @param block the coroutine code
