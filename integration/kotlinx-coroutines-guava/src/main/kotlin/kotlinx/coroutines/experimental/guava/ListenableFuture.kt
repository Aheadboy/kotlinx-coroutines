/**
 * Starts new coroutine and returns its results an an implementation of [ListenableFuture].
 * This coroutine builder uses [CommonPool] context by default.
 *
 * The running coroutine is cancelled when the resulting future is cancelled or otherwise completed.
 * If the [context] for the new coroutine is omitted or is explicitly specified but does not include a
 * coroutine interceptor, then [CommonPool] is used.
 * See [CoroutineDispatcher] for other standard [context] implementations that are provided by `kotlinx.coroutines`.
 * The [context][CoroutineScope.context] of the parent coroutine from its [scope][CoroutineScope] may be used,
 * in which case the [Job] of the resulting coroutine is a child of the job of the parent coroutine.
 *
 * By default, the coroutine is immediately scheduled for execution.
 * Other options can be specified via `start` parameter. See [CoroutineStart] for details.
 * A value of [CoroutineStart.LAZY] is not supported
 * (since `ListenableFuture` framework does not provide the corresponding capability) and
 * produces [IllegalArgumentException].
 *
 * See [newCoroutineContext] for a description of debugging facilities that are available for newly created coroutine.
 *
 * @param context context of the coroutine
 * @param start coroutine start option
